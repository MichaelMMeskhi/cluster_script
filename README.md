# Class Decomposition via Clustering Project

The project can be run by simply executing the build script.

	>>> sh build.sh

Simply cd into the root directory and run the above command.
Note: If you use windows you need to have bash installed.

In the future we will be using more datasets. For that purpose the directory is set up such that all the excel and csv files go in the data folder. The scripts to clean the data and feed it to the neural net are in the src folder. And the functions needed to manage dataframe objects go in the utility folder.
